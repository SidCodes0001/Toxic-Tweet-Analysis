# Toxic-Tweet-Analysis

This project aims to analyze and compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms and vectorization techniques for classifying tweets as toxic or non-toxic.

## Vectorization methods:
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- CountVectorizer

## Classification Models used:

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes

## Observation:
Decision tree and random forest performs best
